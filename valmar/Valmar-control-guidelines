Valmar must start at the same time as the Mars controller. Either via the server or the controller itself


VALMAR functionality
	generation of telemetry
	generation of an beam-gap output in an ASCII file format, preferably a .csv
	logging to console
	check file for commands from the operator/controller. I created a JSON object for this purpose
	archival of all pertinent imagery and console logs


File structure for interfacing with the Mars controller:
	"Valmar-command.json" -- commands and modifies parameters (enable/disable, exposure, psnr_threshold, etc)
	"Valmar-telemetry.csv" -- telemetry for Goddard to parse and save
	"Valmar-beam.gap" -- whatever beam gap output valmar creates. This will be read by Goddard and sent back to the operator.
